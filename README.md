# To the Insiten hiring team:

Hi, and welcome to Touchstone Acquire!  I'm Toby Ladislas, and this is my coding challenge - hope you enjoy!  I had a ton of fun making this!

Link to deployed project:

**Technologies/Tools:**

-React.js  
-Bootstrap.css
-Font Awesome Icons  
-Coolors color scheme generator  


**Features**

-Fully responsive to mobile devices

-Front-end error handling  

**How to use Touchstone Acquire**  

*Adding a new target*  
-To add a new target, click on the plus next to 'Add a new target' text.  
-Fill out the form and click 'add'.  
-If you change your mind halfway through, click the trash can to delete the potential new target.  

*Editing an existing target*  
-On the target you want to edit, click the pencil icon.  
-Update the desired fields.  
-Click 'update' button.  

*Deleting a target*  
-If filters are not active, click the trash can in the lower-right corner of the target's tile.

*Sorting targets*  
-Click how you'd like to sort the targets using the 'Sort by:' dropdown.  

*Filtering targets*  
-Click how you'd like to filter the targets using the 'Filter by:' dropdown.  
-Note: Only one filter at a time can be used, and no updates can be made to a target while the list is filtered.  

**Backlog**  

-Graphing with d3.js or p5.js  
-A 'show' page.  If I had more in-depth knowledge of mergers/acquisitions I could see this happening, but I kept it compact.
